## Introduction
The Automated Testing Framework is designed to streamline the testing process for software packages on Ubuntu. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing test suites, defining test cases, and executing tests.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Automated Testing Framework, follow these steps:
1. Install the framework by following the instructions in the README.md file.
2. Start the backend server using the provided script.
3. Open the frontend interface in a web browser.
4. Create test suites, add test cases, and execute tests using the web interface.

## Managing Test Suites
Test suites are used to organize and group related test cases. To manage test suites:
- Click on the "Test Suites" section in the navigation menu.
- Create a new test suite by entering a name and clicking the "Create" button.
- Edit or delete existing test suites as needed.

## Creating Test Cases
Test cases define specific tests to be executed within a test suite. To create test cases:
- Navigate to the desired test suite.
- Click on the "Create Test Case" button.
- Enter details such as test name, input values, expected outputs, and conditions.
- Save the test case to add it to the test suite.

## Executing Tests
Tests can be executed individually or as part of a test suite. To execute tests:
- Select the test suite containing the tests to be executed.
- Click on the "Execute Tests" button.
- Monitor the progress of test execution and view results once completed.

## Viewing Test Results
Test results are displayed after test execution is complete. To view test results:
- Navigate to the "Test Results" section in the navigation menu.
- Test results are grouped by test suite and display pass/fail statuses for each test case.

That's it! You are now ready to use the Automated Testing Framework to test software packages on Ubuntu.
